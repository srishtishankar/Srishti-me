ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems, particularly in areas like data analyctis, data engineering, predictive modeling, natural language processing, and multimodal data integration.

ğŸ”§ My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, AWS, Tableau, PySpark, and machine learning frameworks.
